------------------------------------ Class - 4 API Automation
Base URI = Base URL + endpoint
API Automation:
           Rest Assured:
                    - to automate API's
                    - it is a DSL (Domain Specific Language)
                    - follows BDD approach
           REST web services
                    - the rest web services allows us to send data in JSON format
           JSON format:
                    - it consists of key and value pair

Rest Assured follows BDD approach

     In Cucumber:
              Given - pre condition
              When - actions
              Then - expected result

     In Rest assured:
              Given - prepare the request
              When - sending the request/hitting the endpoint
              Then - validation of response/expected output

To use json and rest-assured, add dependencies in pom.xml

jsonpath = it returns the keys and values from the path

hamcrest matchers = it is a framework in API which helps us to create matchers for
body. we use it with junit and with other frameworks.

1. creating the employee
2. get the employee
3. update the employee
4. get updated employee

homework:
      - getAlljobTitles
      - getAllEmployee

Rest assured -
Cucumber -

integrate cucumber with rest assured

- feature files - scenarios
- step definitions - write the code for rest assured

Given the request is prepared for creating the employee
given.

------------------------------------ API HardcodedExamples
We will write JUST Hardcoded Examples
   // the intention is to learn how API's works

------------------------------------ Class - 6 Optimizing Automated Test Cases using Rest ASSURED( Sunday class with Moazam)
Question - Answer:

   Q: HTTPS/HTTP protocol
                    A: To send request over the internet
   Q: https/http  must have:
                    A: body , header, url, endpoint
   Q:  How do we send requests?
                    A:  1. UI
                        2. Postman
                        3. Intellij IDE  → using Libraries and writing the code for API request
   Q: Libraries to use for API requests:
                    A: 1. https client
                       2. RestAssured  → ALWAYS prefer this library as a Tester
   Q: Why prefer RestAssured as a tester?
                    A: Gives you a capability of testing and follows BDD format

   Q: A Library that helps us get info from json Object
                    A:  jsonPath

---------------------------------------------
How can we write the API request?:
1. Write down each and every piece of code our self.
2. We use libraries that can help us make these calls.

  RestAssured (IntelliJ):
  1. Set Base URL ( do it once)
  2.
